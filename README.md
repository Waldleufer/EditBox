# ![](pm.eclipse.editbox/icons/editbox.png) TRC Overlay Eclipse plugin

TRCOverlay is using background colors to visualize requirements at sourcecode level.

This Projekt was part of my Bachelor Thesis.

The visualisation is done using functionality from https://github.com/Nodeclipse/EditBox.
The functionalities that are used are marked as such.
Credit for these functionalities goes to Piotr Metel and Paul Verest.
